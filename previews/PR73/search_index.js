It equals the  geometric mean of the probability assigned to each data point by the model, that is, exp(cv_avg). This measure is only meaningful for classifiers (variables with discrete  outcomes). We can think of it as measuring how often the model was right: A model that always predicts incorrectly will have a GMPD of 0, while a model that always predicts correctly will have a GMPD of 1.

We can think of it as measuring how often the model was right: A model that always predicts incorrectly will have a GMPD of 0, while a model that always predicts correctly will have a GMPD of 1.

Total scores are on an interval scale, meaning that only differences of scores are meaningful. It is not possible to interpret a total score by looking at it. The total score is not a goodness-of-fit statistic (for this, see the average score).\n\nThe average score is the total score, divided by the sample size. It estimates the expected log score, i.e. the expectation of the log probability density of observing the next point. The average score is a relative goodness-of-fit statistic which does not depend on sample size. \n\nUnlike for chi-square goodness of fit tests, models do not have to be nested for model comparison using cross-validation methods.\n\nSee also: [loo]@ref, [bayes_cv]@ref, [psis_loo]@ref, [Psis]@ref\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#ParetoSmooth.loo-Tuple","page":"Home","title":"ParetoSmooth.loo","text":"function loo(args...; kwargs...) -> PsisLoo\n\nCompute an approximate leave-one-out cross-validation score.\n\nCurrently, this function only serves to call psis_loo, but this could change in the future.
